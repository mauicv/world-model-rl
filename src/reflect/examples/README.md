# What is this?

This folder contains a collection of samples that where used during development to test different parts of the training pipeline in isolation. For instance `differential_rl` tests the `ValueGradientTrainer` class in a differentiable environment to mimic the process of doing this in an actual trained world model environment. During development these have all gotten out of sync and likely no longer work. So... if you've come here for examples be prepared to be frustrated.

If you'd like to see some examples that _currently_ work then check out any of these:
